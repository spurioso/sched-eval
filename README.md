sched-eval
==========

Schedule evaluator exercise for librarians coding group, based on ideas put forth by Spurioso here: 

* https://github.com/umd-coding-workshop/meetingSchedule.

The idea is to generate every possible permutation of a rotating schedule of meeting days on Mo, Tu, Th, Fr, and to evaluate each one to find out which rotation would produce the most evenly spaced rotation.
Please note: This version works only in Python 3.
